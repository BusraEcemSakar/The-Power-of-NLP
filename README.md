### üë©‚Äçüíª Presented by: Busra Ecem Sakar  
**Date**: October 2, 2024, @WomenCoding Community

## üìÑ Overview

This repository contains a presentation that provides an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP), a field within Artificial Intelligence focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This presentation covers fundamental concepts, techniques, and real-world applications of NLP, highlighting how it transforms unstructured text data into valuable insights.

## üìö Topics Covered

1. **Introduction to NLP**
   - What is NLP?
   - Importance of NLP in various industries

2. **NLP Pipeline**
   - Overview of the NLP pipeline stages
   - Machine learning vs. deep learning approaches

3. **Common NLP Techniques**
   - **Tokenization**: Breaking text into words or sentences
   - **Stopword Removal**: Filtering out commonly used words (e.g., "the", "is")
   - **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base form
   - **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying entities like names, places, dates
   - **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: Assigning grammatical labels (e.g., noun, verb)
   - **Text Vectorization (TF-IDF, Bag of Words)**: Converting text into numerical form
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining positive, negative, or neutral sentiment
   - **Text Classification**: Categorizing text into predefined labels
   - **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT)**: Mapping words to dense vectors
   - **Topic Modeling (LDA)**: Identifying themes within text data

4. **Practical Use Cases**
   - **Customer Feedback Analysis**: Analyzing product reviews to improve recommendations
   - **Chatbots & Virtual Assistants**: Automating responses in customer service
   - **Healthcare**: Assisting in diagnosis by analyzing patient data
   - **Finance**: Detecting fraud and conducting risk assessments
   - **Marketing**: Personalizing content and recommendations based on user preferences
